## Hi there 👋

# About Me

I’m a software engineer who recently completed his **Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech**, passionate about building systems from the ground up — from compilers and distributed frameworks to AI infrastructure.  
Some of these projects began as course work, and others are personal explorations that evolved into ongoing experiments.

## Featured Projects

### Compiler from Scratch  
**Overview:**  
Designed and implemented a full-stack compiler for a custom Tiger-like programming language, covering lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.  
**Tech:** C++, LLVM, CMake, GNU Debugger (GDB)  

---

### Distributed Collective and Sorting Operations  
**Overview:**  
Developed custom implementations of distributed collective operations (e.g., Broadcast, Gather, Reduce) optimized for clarity, scalability, and efficiency.  
**Tech:** C/C++, OpenMP, OpenMPI, CUDA  

---

### MapReduce from Scratch  
**Overview:**  
Built a distributed MapReduce framework capable of processing over 100 jobs per hour across 50 worker nodes, achieving a 90% reduction in job completion time through optimized task scheduling and data partitioning.  
**Tech:** Go, Python, gRPC, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
